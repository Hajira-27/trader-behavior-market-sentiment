Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment Analysis

Project Overview
This project studies the relationship between trader performance and Bitcoin market sentiment using historical trading data from Hyperliquid along with the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index. The main objective is to understand how market sentiment affects trader behavior and to derive practical trading strategies based on these observations.

Datasets Used
Historical Trader Data (Hyperliquid)
This dataset contains transaction-level trading information such as execution price, trade size, trade side, and closed profit or loss.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index
This dataset provides daily Bitcoin market sentiment classifications such as Fear, Extreme Fear, and Greed.

Methodology
Data cleaning and preprocessing were carried out to handle timestamp conversion, missing values, and data type inconsistencies. Feature engineering was then performed to create daily-level performance metrics such as total profit and loss, trading volume, win rate, and trade count. The trader data was aggregated on a daily basis and merged with the market sentiment data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify patterns in trader behavior across different sentiment conditions. Based on these insights, actionable trading strategy recommendations were developed.

Key Insights
Trading activity and volume increase significantly during Greed market conditions.
Profitability during Greed phases is more volatile, indicating higher risk exposure.
Win rates tend to be higher during Fear and Extreme Fear periods.
Market sentiment has a stronger influence on trader behavior than on direct profitability.

Outputs
All visualizations generated during the analysis are stored in the outputs folder. These include charts showing profit and loss, trading volume, win rate, and trade count across different market sentiment conditions.

How to Run the Project
Open the notebook_1.ipynb file in Google Colab.
Upload the CSV files from the csv_files folder.
Run all cells in sequence.
Review the generated visualizations and insights.

Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates the importance of sentiment-aware risk management. Traders who adapt their trading behavior based on prevailing market sentiment may achieve more consistent performance across different market conditions.

Future Work
Future improvements could include incorporating time-series models, lagged sentiment features, and risk-adjusted performance metrics to further enhance analytical depth and predictive capabilities.
